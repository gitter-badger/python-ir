"Even though the glob API is very simple, the module packs a lot of power."
" It is useful in any situation where your program needs to look for a "
"list of files on the filesystem with names matching a pattern. If you "
"need a list of filenames that all have a certain extension, prefix, or "
"any common string in the middle, use :mod:`glob` instead of writing code "
"to scan the directory contents yourself."

msgid ""
"The pattern rules for glob are not regular expressions. Instead, they "
"follow standard Unix path expansion rules. There are only a few special "
"characters: two different wild-cards, and character ranges are supported."
" The patterns rules are applied to segments of the filename (stopping at "
"the path separator, ``/``). Paths in the pattern can be relative or "
"absolute. Shell variable names and tilde (``~``) are not expanded."
