"The filecmp module includes functions and a class for comparing files and"

"By default, cmp() looks only at the information available from os.stat()."
" The shallow argument tells cmp() whether to look at the contents of the "
"file, as well. The default is to perform a shallow comparison, without "
"looking inside the files. Notice that files of the same size created at "
"the same time seem to be the same if their contents are not compared."

"To compare a set of files in two directories without recursing, use "
"filecmp.cmpfiles(). The arguments are the names of the directories and a "
"list of files to be checked in the two locations. The list of common "
"files should contain only filenames (directories always result in a "
"mismatch) and the files must be present in both locations. The code below"
" shows a simple way to build the common list. If you have a shorter "
"formula, post it in the comments. The comparison also takes the shallow "
"flag, just as with cmp()."

"The functions described above are suitable for relatively simple "

" use case, you can print a report comparing two directories with the "
"report() method:"

"The output is a plain-text report showing the results of just the "
"contents of the directories given, without recursing. In this case, the "
"file \"not_the_same\" is thought to be the same because the contents are "
"not being compared. There is no way to have dircmp compare the contents "
"of files like cmp() can."
