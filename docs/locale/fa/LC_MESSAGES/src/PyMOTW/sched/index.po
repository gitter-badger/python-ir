"The :mod:`sched` module implements a generic event scheduler for running "
"tasks at specific times. The scheduler class uses a *time* function to "
"learn the current time, and a *delay* function to wait for a specific "
"period of time. The actual units of time are not important, which makes "
"the interface flexible enough to be used for many purposes."
msgstr ""

#: ../../src/PyMOTW/sched/index.rst:18
msgid ""
"The *time* function is called without any arguments, and should return a "
"number representing the current time. The *delay* function is called with"
" a single integer argument, using the same scale as the time function, "
"and should wait that many time units before returning. For example, the "
"``time.time()`` and ``time.sleep()`` functions meet these requirements."

"To support multi-threaded applications, the delay function is called with"
" argument 0 after each event is generated, to ensure that other threads "

msgid ""
"The call to ``run()`` blocks until all of the events have been processed."
" Each event is run in the same thread, so if an event takes longer to run"
" than the delay between events, there will be overlap. The overlap is "
"resolved by postponing the later event. No events are lost, but some "
"events may be called later than they were scheduled. In the next example,"
" ``long_event()`` sleeps but it could just as easily delay by performing "
"a long calculation or by blocking on I/O."

"The result is the second event is run immediately after the first "
"finishes, since the first event took long enough to push the clock past "

"This example needs to ensure that they are scheduled for the exact same "
"time, so the ``enterabs()`` method is used instead of ``enter()``. The "
"first argument to ``enterabs()`` is the time to run the event, instead of"
" the amount of time to delay."

"Both ``enter()`` and ``enterabs()`` return a reference to the event which"

" to run the scheduler and the main processing thread is used to cancel "
"the event."
