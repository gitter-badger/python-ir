"The first step in working with files is to get the name of the file so "
"you can operate on it.  Python represents filenames as simple strings, "
"but provides tools for building them from standard, platform-independent,"
" components in :mod:`os.path`.  List the contents of a directory with "
"``listdir()`` from :mod:`os`, or use :mod:`glob` to build a list of "
"filenames from a pattern.  Finer grained filtering of filenames is "
"possible with :mod:`fnmatch`."

"Once you know the name of the file, you may want to check other "
"characteristics such as permissions or the file size using ``os.stat()`` "
"and the constants in :mod:`stat`."

"If you're writing a filter application that processes text input line-by-"
"line, :mod:`fileinput` provides an easy framework to get started.  The "
"fileinput API calls for you to iterate over the ``input()`` generator, "
"processing each line as it is yielded.  The generator handles parsing "
"command line arguments for file names, or falling back to reading "
"directly from ``sys.stdin``.  The result is a flexible tool your users "
"can run directly on a file or as part of a pipeline."

"If your app needs random access to files, :mod:`linecache` makes it easy "
"to read lines by their line number.  The contents of the file are "
"maintained in a cache, so be careful of memory consumption."

"For cases where you need to create scratch files to hold data "
"temporarily, or before moving it to a permanent location, :mod:`tempfile`"
" will be very useful.  It provides classes to create temporary files and "
"directories safely and securely.  Names are guaranteed not to collide, "
"and include random components so they are not easily guessable."

"Frequently you need to work on a file as a whole, without worrying about "
"what is in it.  The :mod:`shutil` module includes high-level file "
"operations such as copying files and directories, setting permissions, "
"etc."
