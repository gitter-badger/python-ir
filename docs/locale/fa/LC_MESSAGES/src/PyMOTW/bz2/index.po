"The in-memory approach is not practical for real-world use cases, since "
"you rarely want to hold both the entire compressed and uncompressed data "
"sets in memory at the same time.  The alternative is to use "
":class:`BZ2Compressor` and :class:`BZ2Decompressor` objects to work with "
"streams of data, so that the entire data set does not have to fit into "
"memory."

"The simple server below responds to requests consisting of filenames by "
"writing a compressed version of the file to the socket used to "
"communicate with the client.  It has some artificial chunking in place to"
" illustrate the buffering behavior that happens when the data passed to "
":func:`compress()` or :func:`decompress()` doesn't result in a complete "
"block of compressed or uncompressed output."

"Different compression levels can be used by passing a *compresslevel* "
