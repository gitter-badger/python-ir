"Memory-mapping a file uses the operating system virtual memory system to "
"access the data on the filesystem directly, instead of using normal I/O "
"functions.  Memory-mapping typically improves I/O performance because it "
"does not involve a separate system call for each access and it does not "
"require copying data between buffers -- the memory is accessed directly."

"Memory-mapped files can be treated as mutable strings or file-like "
"objects, depending on your need. A mapped file supports the expected file"
" API methods, such as :func:`close`, :func:`flush`, :func:`read`, "
":func:`readline`, :func:`seek`, :func:`tell`, and :func:`write`. It also "
"supports the string API, with features such as slicing and methods like "
":func:`find`."

"Use the :func:`mmap` function to create a memory-mapped file.  The first "
"argument is a file descriptor, either from the :func:`fileno` method of a"
" :class:`file` object or from :func:`os.open`. The caller is responsible "
"for opening the file before invoking :func:`mmap`, and closing it after "
"it is no longer needed."

"The second argument to :func:`mmap` is a size in bytes for the portion of"

"extended."

"The file pointer tracks the last byte accessed through a slice operation."
"  In this example, the pointer moves ahead 10 bytes after the first read."
"  It is then reset to the beginning of the file by the slice operation, "
"and moved ahead 10 bytes again by the slice.  After the slice operation, "
"calling :func:`read` again gives the bytes 11-20 in the file."
