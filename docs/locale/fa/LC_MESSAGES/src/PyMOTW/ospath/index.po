"The first set of functions in os.path can be used to parse strings "
"representing filenames into their component parts. It is important to "
"realize that these functions do not depend on the paths actually "
"existing; they operate solely on the strings."

"``commonprefix()`` takes a list of paths as an argument and returns a "

"When your program encounters a path name, it often needs to know whether "
