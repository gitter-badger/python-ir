"There are a set of module-level functions for working with structured "
"values, and there is also the :class:`Struct` class (new in Python 2.5)."
"  Format specifiers are converted from their string format to a compiled "
"representation, similar to the way regular expressions are. The "
"conversion takes some resources, so it is typically more efficient to do "
"it once when creating a :class:`Struct` instance and call methods on the "
"instance instead of using the module-level functions. All of the examples"
" below use the :class:`Struct` class."

"Structs support *packing* data into strings, and *unpacking* data from "
"strings using format specifiers made up of characters representing the "
"type of the data and optional count and endian-ness indicators.  For "
"complete details, refer to `the standard library documentation "
"<http://docs.python.org/library/struct.html>`__."

"In this example, the format specifier calls for an integer or long value,"
" a two character string, and a floating point number.  The spaces between"
" the format specifiers are included here for clarity, and are ignored "
"when the format is compiled."

"Working with binary packed data is typically reserved for highly "
"performance sensitive situations or passing data into and out of "
"extension modules.  In such situations, you can optimize by avoiding the "
"overhead of allocating a new buffer for each packed structure. The "
":meth:`pack_into` and :meth:`unpack_from` methods support writing to pre-"
"allocated buffers directly."
