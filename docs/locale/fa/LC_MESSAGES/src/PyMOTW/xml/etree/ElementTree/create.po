"In addition to its parsing capabilities, :mod:`xml.etree.ElementTree` "
"also supports creating well-formed XML documents from :class:`Element` "
"objects constructed in an application.  The :class:`Element` class used "
"when a document is parsed also knows how to generate a serialized form of"
" its contents, which can then be written to a file or other data stream."

"There are three helper functions useful for creating a hierarchy of "

":class:`ElementTree` makes no effort to \"pretty print\" the output "

"<http://renesd.blogspot.com/2007/05/pretty-print-xml-with-python.html>`_ "

"The previous example created nodes with tags and text content, but did "
"not set any attributes of the nodes.  Many of the examples from "
":ref:`xml.etree.ElementTree.parsing` worked with an OPML_ file listing "
"podcasts and their feeds.  The ``outline`` nodes in the tree used "
