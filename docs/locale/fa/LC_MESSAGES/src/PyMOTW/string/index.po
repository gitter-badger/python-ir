"The :mod:`string` module dates from the earliest versions of Python. In "
"version 2.0, many of the functions previously implemented only in the "
"module were moved to methods of :class:`str` and :class:`unicode` "
"objects. Legacy versions of those functions are still available, but "
"their use is deprecated and they will be dropped in Python 3.0. The "
":mod:`string` module still contains several useful constants and classes "
"for working with string and unicode objects, and this discussion will "
"concentrate on them."

msgid "Constants"
msgstr ""

#: ../../src/PyMOTW/string/index.rst:23
msgid ""
"The constants in the string module can be used to specify categories of "
"characters such as ``ascii_letters`` and ``digits``. Some of the "
"constants, such as ``lowercase``, are locale-dependent so the value "
"changes to reflect the language settings of the user. Others, such as "
"``hexdigits``, do not change when the locale changes."

"There are two functions not moving from the string module. "
":func:`capwords()` capitalizes all of the words in a string."
msgstr ""

#: ../../src/PyMOTW/string/index.rst:81
msgid ""
"The results are the same as if you called :func:`split()`, capitalized "
"the words in the resulting list, then called :func:`join()` to combine "
"the results."

"The other function creates translation tables that can be used with the "
":func:`translate()` method to change one set of characters to another."

"In this example, some letters are replaced by their `l33t "

msgid "Templates"
msgstr ""

#: ../../src/PyMOTW/string/index.rst:125
msgid ""
"String templates were added in Python 2.4 as part of :pep:`292` and are "
"intended as an alternative to the built-in interpolation syntax. With "
":class:`string.Template` interpolation, variables are identified by name "
"prefixed with ``$`` (e.g., ``$var``) or, if necessary to set them off "
"from surrounding text, they can also be wrapped with curly braces (e.g., "
"``${var}``)."

"This example compares a simple template with a similar string "
"interpolation setup."

"As you see, in both cases the trigger character (``$`` or ``%``) is "
"escaped by repeating it twice."
msgstr ""

#: ../../src/PyMOTW/string/index.rst:163
msgid ""
"One key difference between templates and standard string interpolation is"
" that the type of the arguments is not taken into account. The values are"
" converted to strings, and the strings are inserted into the result. No "
"formatting options are available. For example, there is no way to control"
" the number of digits used to represent a floating point value."
msgstr ""

#: ../../src/PyMOTW/string/index.rst:170
msgid ""
"A benefit, though, is that by using the :func:`safe_substitute()` method,"
" it is possible to avoid exceptions if not all of the values needed by "
"the template are provided as arguments."
msgstr ""

#: ../../src/PyMOTW/string/index.rst:178
msgid ""
"Since there is no value for missing in the values dictionary, a "
":ref:`KeyError <exceptions-KeyError>` is raised by :func:`substitute()`. "
"Instead of raising the error, :func:`safe_substitute()` catches it and "
"leaves the variable expression alone in the text."

"If the default syntax for :class:`string.Template` is not to your liking,"
" you can change the behavior by adjusting the regular expression patterns"
" it uses to find the variable names in the template body. A simple way to"
" do that is to change the *delimiter* and *idpattern* class attributes."
msgstr ""

#: ../../src/PyMOTW/string/index.rst:210
msgid ""
"In this example, variable ids must include an underscore somewhere in the"
" middle, so ``%notunderscored`` is not replaced by anything."
msgstr ""

#: ../../src/PyMOTW/string/index.rst:225
msgid ""
"For more complex changes, you can override the *pattern* attribute and "
"define an entirely new regular expression. The pattern provided must "
"contain four named groups for capturing the escaped delimiter, the named "
"variable, a braced version of the variable name, and invalid delimiter "
"patterns."

msgid "Let's look at the default pattern:"

"Since ``t.pattern`` is a compiled regular expression, we have to access "
"its pattern attribute to see the actual string."
