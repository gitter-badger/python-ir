":mod:`cgitb` was originally designed for showing errors and debugging "
"information in web applications.  It was later updated to include plain-"
"text output as well, but unfortunately wasn't renamed.  This has led to "
"obscurity and the module is not used as often as it should be. "
"Nonetheless, :mod:`cgitb` is a valuable debugging tool in the standard "
"library."

"Python's default exception handling behavior is to print a *traceback* to"
" standard error with the call stack leading up to the error position.  "
"This basic output frequently contains enough information to understand "
"the cause of the exception and permit a fix."

"While the basic traceback includes enough information for us to spot the "
"error, enabling cgitb replaces ``sys.excepthook`` with a function that "
"gives extended tracebacks with even more detail."

"In the case of this code with a :ref:`ZeroDivisionError <exceptions-"

"The code in :mod:`cgitb` that examines the variables used in the stack "

msgid ""
"Suppose your function includes a lot of inline comments, whitespace, or "
"other code that makes it very long.  Having the default of 5 lines of "
"context may not be enough help in that case, if the body of the function "
"is pushed out of the code window displayed.  Using a larger context value"
" when enabling cgitb gets around this."
