"To avoid problems with duplicating recursive data structures, "

"This example shows how an interconnected data structure such as a Digraph"

" already handles the recursion cases correctly."

"First, some basic directed graph methods: A graph can be initialized with"

#: ../../src/PyMOTW/copy/index.rst:139
msgid ""
"The ``__deepcopy__()`` method prints messages to show how it is called, "
"and manages the memo dictionary contents as needed. Instead of copying "
"the connection list wholesale, it creates a new list and appends copies "
"of the individual connections to it. That ensures that the memo "
"dictionary is updated as each new node is duplicated, and avoids "
"recursion issues or extra copies of nodes. As before, it returns the "
"copied object when it is done."

"The second time the *root* node is encountered, while the *a* node is "
