msgid ""
"A :class:`Counter` is a container that keeps track of how many times "
"equivalent values are added.  It can be used to implement the same "
"algorithms for which bag or multiset data structures are commonly used in"
" other languages."

msgid "Initializing"
msgstr ""

#: ../../src/PyMOTW/collections/counter.rst:13
msgid ""
":class:`Counter` supports three forms of initialization.  Its constructor"
" can be called with a sequence of items, a dictionary containing keys and"
" counts, or using keyword arguments mapping string names to counts."
msgstr ""

#: ../../src/PyMOTW/collections/counter.rst:22
msgid "The results of all three forms of initialization are the same."

"An empty :class:`Counter` can be constructed with no arguments and "
"populated via the :func:`update` method."
msgstr ""

#: ../../src/PyMOTW/collections/counter.rst:45
msgid ""
"The count values are increased based on the new data, rather than "
"replaced.  In this example, the count for ``a`` goes from ``3`` to ``4``."

msgid "Accessing Counts"
msgstr ""

#: ../../src/PyMOTW/collections/counter.rst:66
msgid ""
"Once a :class:`Counter` is populated, its values can be retrieved using "
"the dictionary API."
msgstr ""

#: ../../src/PyMOTW/collections/counter.rst:73
msgid ""
":class:`Counter` does not raise :ref:`KeyError <exceptions-KeyError>` for"
" unknown items.  If a value has not been seen in the input (as with ``e``"
" in this example), its count is ``0``."

msgid ""
"The :func:`elements` method returns an iterator that produces all of the "
"items known to the :class:`Counter`."

msgid ""
"The order of elements is not guaranteed, and items with counts less than "
"zero are not included."

"Use :func:`most_common` to produce a sequence of the *n* most frequently "
"encountered input values and their respective counts."
msgstr ""

#: ../../src/PyMOTW/collections/counter.rst:123
msgid ""
"This example counts the letters appearing in all of the words in the "
"system dictionary to produce a frequency distribution, then prints the "
"three most common letters.  Leaving out the argument to "
":func:`most_common` produces a list of all the items, in order of "
"frequency."

msgid ""
":class:`Counter` instances support arithmetic and set operations for "
"aggregating results."
msgstr ""

#: ../../src/PyMOTW/collections/counter.rst:154
msgid ""
"Each time a new :class:`Counter` is produced through an operation, any "
"items with zero or negative counts are discarded.  The count for ``a`` is"
" the same in :data:`c1` and :data:`c2`, so subtraction leaves it at zero."
