"On the other hand, remembering which index should be used for each value "
"can lead to errors, especially if the :class:`tuple` has a lot of fields "
"and is constructed far from where it is used.  A :class:`namedtuple` "

":class:`namedtuple` instances are just as memory efficient as regular "
"tuples because they do not have per-instance dictionaries.  Each kind of "
":class:`namedtuple` is represented by its own class, created by using the"
" :func:`namedtuple` factory function.  The arguments are the name of the "
"new class and a string containing the names of the elements."

"As the example illustrates, it is possible to access the fields of the "
":class:`namedtuple` by name using dotted notation (``obj.attr``) as well "
"as using the positional indexes of standard tuples."

"In situations where a :class:`namedtuple` is being created based on "
