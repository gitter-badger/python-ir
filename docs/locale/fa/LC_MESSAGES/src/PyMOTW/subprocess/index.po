"The :mod:`subprocess` module provides a consistent interface to creating "
"and working with additional processes. It offers a higher-level interface"
" than some of the other available modules, and is intended to replace "
"functions such as :func:`os.system`, :func:`os.spawn*`, "
":func:`os.popen*`, :func:`popen2.*` and :func:`commands.*`. To make it "
"easier to compare :mod:`subprocess` with those other modules, many of the"
" examples here re-create the ones used for :mod:`os` and :mod:`popen`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../src/PyMOTW/subprocess/index.rst:20
msgid ""
"The :mod:`subprocess` module defines one class, :class:`Popen` and a few "
"wrapper functions that use that class. The constructor for :class:`Popen`"
" takes arguments to set up the new process so the parent can communicate "
"with it via pipes.  It provides all of the functionality of the other "
"modules and functions it replaces, and more. The API is consistent for "
"all uses, and many of the extra steps of overhead needed (such as closing"
" extra file descriptors and ensuring the pipes are closed) are \"built "
"in\" instead of being handled by the application code separately."

"The API is roughly the same, but the underlying implementation is "
"slightly different between Unix and Windows. All of the examples shown "
