"Abstract base classes are a form of interface checking more strict than "
"individual ``hasattr()`` checks for particular methods.  By defining an "
"abstract base class, you can define a common API for a set of subclasses."
"  This capability is especially useful in situations where a third-party "
"is going to provide implementations, such as with plugins to an "
"application, but can also aid you when working on a large team or with a "
"large code-base where keeping all classes in your head at the same time "
"is difficult or not possible."

":mod:`abc` works by marking methods of the base class as abstract, and "
"then registering concrete classes as implementations of the abstract "
"base.  If your code requires a particular API, you can use "
"``issubclass()`` or ``isinstance()`` to check an object against the "
"abstract class."

"A side-effect of using direct subclassing is it is possible to find all "

"Although a concrete class must provide an implementation of an abstract "
