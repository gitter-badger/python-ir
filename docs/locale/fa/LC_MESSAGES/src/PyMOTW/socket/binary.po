"Sockets transmit streams of bytes.  Those bytes can contain text "
"messages, as in the previous examples, or they can be made up of binary "
"data that has been encoded for transmission.  To prepare binary data "
"values for transmission, pack them into a buffer with :mod:`struct`."

"The floating point value loses some precision as it is packed and "
"unpacked, but otherwise the data is transmitted as expected.  One thing "
"to keep in mind is that depending on the value of the integer, it may be "
"more efficient to convert it to text and then transmit, instead of using "
":mod:`struct`.  The integer ``1`` uses one byte when represented as a "
"string, but four when packed into the structure."
