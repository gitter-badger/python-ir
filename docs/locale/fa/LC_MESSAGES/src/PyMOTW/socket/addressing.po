"A *socket* is one endpoint of a communication channel used by programs to"
" pass data back and forth locally or across the Internet.  Sockets have "
"two primary properties controlling the way they send data: the *address "
"family* controls the OSI network layer protocol used and the *socket "
"type* controls the transport layer protocol."

"Python supports three address families.  The most common, "
":const:`AF_INET`, is used for IPv4 Internet addressing.  IPv4 addresses "
"are made up of four octal values separated by dots (e.g., ``10.1.1.5`` "
"and ``127.0.0.1``).  These values are more commonly referred to as \"IP "
"addresses.\"  Almost all Internet networking is done using IP version 4 "
"at this time."

msgid ""
":const:`AF_INET6` is used for IPv6 Internet addressing.  IPv6 is the "
"\"next generation\" version of the Internet protocol, and supports "
"128-bit addresses, traffic shaping, and routing features not available "
"under IPv4.  Adoption of IPv6 is still limited, but continues to grow."

":const:`AF_UNIX` is the address family for Unix Domain Sockets (UDS), an "
"interprocess communication protocol available on POSIX-compliant systems."
"  The implementation of UDS typically allows the operating system to pass"
" data directly from process to process, without going through the network"
" stack.  This is more efficient than using :const:`AF_INET`, but because "
"the filesystem is used as the namespace for addressing, UDS is restricted"
" to processes on the same system. The appeal of using UDS over other IPC "
"mechanisms such as named pipes or shared memory is that the programming "
"interface is the same as for IP networking, so the application can take "
"advantage of efficient communication when running on a single host, but "
"use the same code when sending data across the network."

"The socket type is usually either :const:`SOCK_DGRAM` for *user datagram "
"protocol* (UDP) or :const:`SOCK_STREAM` for *transmission control "
"protocol* (TCP).  UDP does not require transmission handshaking or other "
"setup, but offers lower reliability of delivery.  UDP messages may be "
"delivered out of order, more than once, or not at all.  TCP, by contrast,"
" ensures that each message is delivered exactly once, and in the correct "
"order.  Most application protocols that deliver a large amount of data, "
"such as HTTP, are built on top of TCP.  UDP is commonly used for "
"protocols where order is less important (since the message fits in a "
"single packet, i.e., DNS), or for *multicasting* (sending the same data "
"to several hosts)."
