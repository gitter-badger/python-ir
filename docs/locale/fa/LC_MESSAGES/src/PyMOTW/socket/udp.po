"The user datagram protocol (UDP) works differently from TCP/IP.  Where "
"TCP is a *stream oriented* protocol, ensuring that all of the data is "
"transmitted in the right order, UDP is a *message oriented* protocol. UDP"
" does not require a long-lived connection, so setting up a UDP socket is "
"a little simpler.  On the other hand, UDP messages must fit within a "
"single packet (for IPv4, that means they can only hold 65,507 bytes "
"because the 65,535 byte packet also includes header information) and "
"delivery is not guaranteed as it is with TCP."

"Since there is no connection, per se, the server does not need to listen "
"for and accept connections.  It only needs to use :func:`bind` to "
"associate its socket with a port, and then wait for individual messages."

"Messages are read from the socket using :func:`recvfrom`, which returns "
"the data as well as the address of the client from which it was sent."

msgid ""
"The UDP echo client is similar the server, but does not use :func:`bind` "
"to attach its socket to an address.  It uses :func:`sendto` to deliver "
"its message directly to the server, and :func:`recvfrom` to receive the "
"response."
